This is a test text for the readtext python script. 
I assumed that this script runs on Macintosh computer, because this
script uses say command. 
You can choose every text file you want make be read by this script. 
But, this script can read only English text file. 
You can improve this script as you like, such as reading Japanese text
file. 
Enjoy!!!
